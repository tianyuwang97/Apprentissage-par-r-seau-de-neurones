# RL_For_Complex_Tasks

This project has been done as part of my studies as an AI MSc student at Sorbonne University.
The aim is to study and re-implement the content the following paper "Self-improving reactive agents based on reinforcement learning, planning and teaching",
written by Mr. Long-Ji Lin in 1992 (link to the article : https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2FBF00992699.pdf).
The article deals with the performance of Reinforcement Learning on complexe tasks and how it could be improved.
More precisely, eight reinforcement learning frameworks are compared : adaptative heuristic critic (AHC) learning, as well as Q-Learning (QCON), and three extensions to both
basic methods for speeding up learning.
Those extensions are :
- Experience Replay
- Learning Action Models for Plannig
- Teaching
However, as part of the projet, only Q-Learning (QCON) and Q-Learning with Experience Replay (QCON-R) will be implemented, the end goal being to obtain the same performances and
plots presented at the end of the paper.
